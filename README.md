# Stack & Queue
This Repository contains programs of Stack & Queue in Python. It contains concepts of Stack, Queue, Dequeue, Enqueue, Linked Lists & other concepts related to these major topics in Data Structures. Following are the programs available in this repository:

- Checking Palindrome using Stack & Queue
- Calculating Total runtime.
- Linked Lists.
- Greatest Element in an Array.
- Enqueue & Dequeue elements in an array for 'n' times.

## Objectives

<b>

OBJECT 1: Write a python program to check of the given string is palindrome or not
using stack.

OBJECT 2: Write a python program to check of the given string is palindrome or not
using deque.
Compare the running time of both of your programs and interpret the results.

OBJECT 3:
Write a program that takes two positive integers (say M, N) as inputs.
It should first enqueue N random integers one by one into a queue, and then dequeue
the N elements.
This process should be repeated M times.
Use the following in turn to store the queue:

(a) a usual Python list

(b) the alternative implementation suggested above, and compare the times
taken by the two implementations.

OBJECT 4:
Implement stack and queues USING linked list

## Features

- Stack: These programs contains concept of stack to understand concept of Stack.
- Queue: These programs contains concept/method of queue to understand concept of Queue.
- Linked List: A major topic/concept of linked list is covered by using stack & queue to understand & differentiate major inequalities.
